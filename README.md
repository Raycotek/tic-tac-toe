## Part 1: Tic Tac Toe

A two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe, played through the command line.

The game first asks for the two players' names. Play then starts, with players taking turns to enter a square on the grid to place their symbol (X or O).

Players select a square using one of the following two-letter combinations:

- TL, TM or TR -- Top row, Left, Middle or Right square
- ML, MM or MR -- Middle row
- BL, BM or BR -- Bottom row

Play is over when a player completes a 3-square line of his/her symbol in any direction (victory), or when all squares are filled and no player has made a 3-square line (draw).
