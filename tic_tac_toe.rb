# Start game
# - get player names, X or O 
# - draw empty board
# Turn
# - Player makes move
# - redraw board
# - set next player's turn 
# Check for Game Over
# - if no, back to Turn
# - if draw, declare draw
# - if victory, declare victory
# - ask to play again?

# To Do:
# @board should be kept simple, 3x3 grid
# Game#draw should handle complexities of drawing a good-looking game
# - each square 2x2? Maybe 4x4 with the icons 2x2?
# board, X's and O's graphics should have a class each, in a graphic file
